What 'pd.get_dummies' does is to perform one-hot encoding, so 'pd.get_dummies' map each categorical column into
a vector that contains 1,0 showing whether the feature is present or not. 
Advantages: The reason why we use one-hot encoding ('pd.get_dummies') is because there are a some limited machine learning
algorithms, for example decision tree that can be learned directly from categorical data with no data transform required.
However many machine learning algorithms cannot work directly on labeled data, so they required all input variables and 
output variables to be numeric. Moreover, representing data in the form of dummy variables makes it easier to make decisions
based on them.

Drawbacks: because the Nr. of the vectors depends on the Nr. of categories for features, as a results this methods generates
a lot of columns which decelerate the learning considerably if the Nr. of category is very high for the feature
