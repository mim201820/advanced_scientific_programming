SVMs and decision trees are discriminative because they learn explicit boundaries between classes. 
SVM is a maximal margin classifier, meaning that it learns a decision boundary that maximizes the distance between 
samples of the two classes, given a kernel. The distance between a sample and the learned decision boundary can be
used to make the SVM a "soft" classifier. DTs learn the decision boundary by recursively partitioning the space 
in a manner that maximizes the information gain (or another criterion).

Now let's talk about the fairness:
fairness means if we for example swap the colums values as we did in genders "female"-->"male" and "male"-->"female" 
we expect to receive the same but swaped results.

In SVM , Decision Tree as we can see , when we changed the genders still we get the same result so by using these two 
methods regardless of the gender it gives the correct result.
However, in Naive Bayes the results are totatlly different, even we changed the genders and we expected the same reult
as before, we did not reach the same result by swapping , as I read in the paper 'Learning Fair Naive Bayes Classifiers by
Discovering and Eliminating Discrimination Patterns',  Naive Bayes is not fair classifier , as a consequence , it needs
some improvement to make it fair.
