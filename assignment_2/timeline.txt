 As we can see there are some fluctuations specially in the early years from 1000 to 1900, but when there is a major event in the history of Germany or the world the number of referenced years increases drastically, for example around the WW1 and WW2 years, there are a significant growth in the diagram. In general, since the mid-twentieth century the amount of year increases gradually. We see that before 1914, the occurrence of years in the English version is more than the Deutch version, maybe because we lost some information in the Deutch version since Wikipedia is a global platform and English is more global than German that's why we have more information in English than German, but after 1914 we see that the occurrence is almost the same because that period has a big importance in the history that's why we don't see a big loss of information
